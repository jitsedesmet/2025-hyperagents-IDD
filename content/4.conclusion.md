## Conclusion
{:#conclusion}

The goal of this vision paper is to convince the broader research community of the importance of expressing
the relation between reads and writes,
and expressing the relation between data interfaces and the underlying dataset in more detail.
When follow reserachers are convinced about this vision, a next step might be a community working group.


Future work:
1. Investigate policy mechanisms
