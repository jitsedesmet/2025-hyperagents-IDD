## Conclusion
{:#conclusion}

This vision article argues for a new way of understanding and describing data interfaces -
by formally linking reads and writes through algebraic flows, explicitly modeling intermediate resources.
As autonomous agents become more prevalent,
the need for machine-understandable interface semantics becomes increasingly important.
Current approaches, which often rely on human-readable or symmetric interface definitions,
fall short in conveying the consequences of actions,
especially across heterogeneous, evolving, or asymmetric interfaces.

By introducing algebraic data flows, we propose a foundation for explicitly modeling read and write operations over stateful and bus resources.
This shift enables agents to reason not only about what data is available,
but also how it was derived and how it can be meaningfully modified.
Importantly, we believe integrating this approach does not require substantial new expertise.
When implementing a data interface, developers are often already writing queries to access and modify some underlying database.
Our approach suggests a shift in mindset: also model these intermediate resources to the outside and describe the semantic behavior of interfaces.

Looking ahead, several promising research directions emerge:
1. Making the system theoretically sound by describing the required algorithms and constructing a vocabulary.
2. Policy-aware semantics: enabling fine-grained control over access and data transformations. Since we require asymmetric interfaces due to policy management needs,
it would be interesting to see the consequences of modeling policies within the description. 
3. Privacy-preserving flows, where interface descriptions themselves can be selectively disclosed or obfuscated.

The authors next step will be to tackle the first point, and creating a proof-of-concept implementation.
Additionally, we hope this paper catalyzes discussion within the broader research community.
