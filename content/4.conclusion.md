## Conclusion
{:#conclusion}

We propose a new approach to data interface descriptions by formally linking reads and writes through algebraic flows and explicitly modeling underlying resources.
As autonomous agents become more prevalent, machine-understandable interface semantics are essential,
especially for heterogeneous and asymmetric systems.

By introducing algebraic data flows, we propose a foundation for explicitly modeling read and write operations over both exposed and underlying resources.
This shift enables agents to reason not only about what data is available,
but also how it was derived and how it can be meaningfully modified.
This approach builds on skills developers already use to write queries,
requiring only a shift in mindset: modeling underlying resources explicitly and exposing interface semantics.

Future work includes formalizing the system with a defined vocabulary and algorithms,
exploring policy-aware semantics for fine-grained control, and developing privacy-preserving flows where interface descriptions can be selectively disclosed.
The authors next step will be to tackle the first point and create a proof-of-concept implementation.
