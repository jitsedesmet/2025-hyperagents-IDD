## Conclusion
{:#conclusion}

This vision paper argues for a new way of understanding and describing data interfaces -
by formally linking reads and writes through algebraic flows.
As autonomous agents become more prevalent,
the need for machine-understandable interface semantics becomes increasingly important.
Current approaches, which often rely on human-readable or symmetric interface definitions,
fall short in conveying the consequences of actions,
especially across heterogeneous, evolving, or asymmetric infrastructures.

By introducing the concept of Interface Data Descriptions (IDDs),
we propose a foundation for modeling read and write operations as algebraic transformations over state and event spaces.
This shift enables agents to reason not only about what data is available,
but also how it was derived and how it can be meaningfully modified.
Importantly, we believe integrating this approach does not require substantial new expertise.
When implementing a data interface, developers are often already writing queries to access and modify an underlying database.
Our approach suggests a shift in mindset: from writing queries that directly manipulate state,
to defining flows that describe the semantic behavior of the interface.

Looking ahead, several promising research directions emerge:
1. Making the system theoretically sound by describing the required algorithms and constructing an official vocabulary.
2. Policy-aware semantics: enabling fine-grained control over access and data transformations. Since we require asymmetric interfaces due to policy management needs,
it would be interesting to see the consequences of modeling policies withing the description. 
3. Privacy-preserving flows, where interface descriptions themselves can be selectively disclosed or obfuscated.

We hope this paper catalyzes discussion within the broader research community,
and we envision a potential path forward through a W3C community group or similar initiatives.
