## Introduction

Many years of exposing semantic data has learned the semantic web community valuable lessons.
One of those lessons has been that [the perfect interface does not exist](cites:cites tpf, hartig2017formal).
In fact, the perfect interface depends on the current query type and load, which is use case dependent.

As such, a dataset that is used in multiple use cases, with possibly vastly different requirements,
could benefit from being exposed through heterogeneous interfaces, effectively creating a [polyglot system](cite:cites khine2019review).
This case of a dataset being required currently exists in the world of personal datastore's,
be it for agentic AI systems or decentralized data ecosystems in general.
A single organisations data is consumed in various use-cases.

When multiple interfaces expose the same data however,
it is essential that the interfaces describe their relationship to each-other by individually describing their relation to the data.
As such, multiple interfaces can expose the same, partially overlapping data, and consumers of these interfaces will understand this relation.

Currently, effectively querying data and effectively exposing data is seen as separate problems since
each party, the data consumer and data provider want to optimize with their own constraints in mind.
This sometimes causes a language mismatch since both parties actually
just want effective communication stimulating the flow and effective use of data.

Traditionally, data providers describe their interface by providing a human-readable description of what
actions the server will preform and what data the client can expect when performing a certain operation.
In the context of web interfaces, these operations consist of a method called on some URI using a body and metadata headers.
This human-readable description however fails to label the effective dataset being used - it is just assumed that a single description is used for a single dataset - but this assumption is false in the context of polyglot datasets.

Another approach to describe data interfaces has been to define the semantics of the returned data.

What to the best of the authors knowledge has not been tried is to express the relationshiop of an interface through algebraic definitions such as SQL algebra or SPARQL algebra.
When your data model exists in a space $ \doubleD $ and you have an algebra that works from $ doubleO -> doubleO $,
you can express data as iot evolves throughout the system.

Additionally, there is the need of a description when you are dealing with ever-changing interfaces.
