## Introduction
{:#introduction}

[Decentralized data ecosystems](cite:cites solid, idsa, gaia-x) are reshaping how data is stored, accessed, and governed.
Rather than centralizing data around _data consumers_, these ecosystems center around _data producers_,
empowering individuals and organizations to maintain agency and control while facilitating collaboration.
This shift brings clear benefits:
<!-- -->
1. it facilitates _collaboration across organizational boundaries_ despite differing data models and objectives,
2. it _reduces data duplication_ through fine-grained access policies, and
3. it enables diverse applications to _reuse shared data sources_.
<!-- -->
These properties are particularly beneficial in the re-emerging age of agentic AI wherein
autonomous systems act on behalf of individuals,
since the agents could better understand the individual after consuming their personal data store.

However, agentic systems –
whether powered by stochastic language models or deterministic query engines –
require a precise understanding of both the semantics and the consequences of the actions they perform.
When these systems interact with decentralized data sources, they need to know:
<!-- -->
1. What does it _mean_ to write data here?
2. What _state changes_ will this action trigger?
3. How do the endpoints of interface reflect those changes after completion?
<!-- -->
In practice, today's interfaces rarely answer these questions fully.
Descriptions are often partial, human-readable, and inconsistently maintained.
As a result,
autonomous agents operate with brittle assumptions and incomplete models of the systems they interact with.

One key insight from previous research is that simple interfaces (e.g. [LDP](cite:cites spec:ldp)) –
where the manipulation of one resource does not have effects on the manipulation of another,
and where CRUD operations happen on the same resource, meaning updates are not performed on some intermediate resource (e.g. a database)
[have difficulty supporting complex access policies required in these ecosystems](cite:cites whatsinapod).
Asymmetric interfaces,
in which interfaces depend on intermediate resources, the manipulation of one resource can have consequences on the manipulation of another,
and data manipulation methods can be used to enact consistency boundaries,
are a more promising fit.
Unfortunately, the inclusion of intermediate resources introduces a new challenge, as write semantics become opaque,
agents no longer know what resources are manipulated and how when performing a single write.
This semantic gap prevents agents from reliably reasoning over their own actions.
At the same time, the same resources can be exposed in different ways, such as through different fragmentations or interaction methods,
each having their own benefits and drawbacks [](cite:cites tpf, hartig2017formal).
Moreover, in dynamic environments these [choices of fragmentation and interaction methods can change](cite:cites dynamic-interfaces),
mirroring the elasticity of cloud infrastructure.

To manage these complexities,
we propose a framework that algebraically describes (e.g. relational or SPARQL algebra) the relationship between write operations,
resource manipulations, and the exposed resource representations using shape descriptions (e.g. [ShEx](cite:cites shex)).

Visual representation of the interface for our use case.
The interface exposes a pet doctors database containing owners with their pets.
Resources are modeled on a white background identified with the IRI.
Ovals are exposed resources and the arrows depict explicitly modeled dependencies between resources.
This description allows the agent of our pet owner Bob to register himself and his pets to the system,
and it also allows the agent of another doctor to get the medical history of Bob's cats when he has an emergency doctor visit.

<!-- ### Motivating use case -->

Throughout this paper we will use [](#interface-viz) as an example use case to motivate our approach.
Our use case is an interface around a pet doctors database registering pet-owners and their pets.
We include four endpoint families:
1. [**\<post-owner\>**](#1.post-owner): registers a new owner and their pets in the system.
2. [**\<change-owner\>**](#3.change-owner): transfers a pet from one registered owner to another.
3. [**\<get-owners\>**](#5.get-owners): retrieves a list of URIs representing all registered owners.
4. [**\<get-owner\>**](#6.get-owner): fetches an individual owner along with their associated pets + pet data.
Important to note is that our system _explicitly_ models the `<database>` information resource, meaning other systems can now reference the resource 
'_all owners and their pets registered in the system_', and deduce what endpoints manipulate and expose it.

This paper presents a vision for a future in which interfaces formally describe their underlying resources and how to manipulate them,
creating rich, composable, and formal interface semantics.
Our goal is to stimulate discussion on how such descriptions can support autonomous operation,
improve agent reliability, and pave the way for more interoperable and adaptive knowledge infrastructures.
While the proposed direction remains conceptual,
we offer initial ideas and mappings that illustrate how this approach could be realized in practice.
