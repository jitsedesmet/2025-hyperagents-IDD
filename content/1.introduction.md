## Introduction
{:#introduction}

[Decentralized data ecosystems](cite:cites solid, idsa, gaia-x) are reshaping how data is stored, accessed, and governed.
Rather than centralizing data around consumers, these ecosystems center data around producers,
empowering individuals and organizations to maintain ownership and control while facilitating collaboration.
This shift brings clear benefits:
1. it facilitates collaboration across organizational boundaries despite differing data models and objectives,
2. it reduces redundant data replication through fine-grained access policies, and
3. it enables diverse applications to reuse shared data sources.
These properties are particularly beneficial in the re-emerging age of agentic AI -
autonomous systems capable of acting on behalf of individuals.

However, agentic systems -
whether powered by stochastic language models or deterministic query engines -
require a precise understanding of both the semantics and the consequences of the actions they perform.
When these systems interact with decentralized data sources, they need to know:
1. What does it mean to write data here?
2. What changes will this action trigger?
3. How are resources and their representations manipulated after performing such an operation?
In practice, today's interfaces rarely answer these questions fully.
Descriptions are often partial, human-readable, and inconsistently maintained.
As a result,
autonomous agents operate with brittle assumptions and incomplete models of the systems they interact with.

<!-- I think a lot of this can be removed since the focus is no longer on 'just' decentralized data ecosystems -->
One key insight from previous research is that simple interfaces (e.g. [LDP](cite:cites spec:ldp)) - 
where the manipulation of one resource does not have effects on the manipulation of another,
and where data manipulations outside of CRUD are not supported -
[fails to support the complex policy definitions required in these ecosystems](cite:cites whatsinapod).
Asymmetric interfaces,
in which the manipulation of one resource can have consequences on the manipulation of another,
and data manipulation methods can be used to enact consistency boundaries,
are a more promising fit.
Unfortunately, they introduce a new challenge for autonomous agents, as write semantics become opaque.
A write operation to one endpoint can have various consequences on different resources.
This creates a semantic gap that prevents agents from reliably reasoning over their own actions.
At the same time, resources can be exposed in different ways, such as through different fragmentations or interaction methods,
each having their own benefits and drawbacks [](cite:cites tpf, hartig2017formal).
Moreover, in dynamic environments these [choices of fragmentation and interaction methods can change](cite:cites dynamic-interfaces),
mirroring the elasticity of cloud infrastructure.

To manage these complexities,
we argue for the need of a framework that algebraically describes (e.g. relational or SPARQL algebra) the relationship between write operations,
resource manipulations, and the exposed resource representations using shape graphs.

Throughout this paper we will use [](#interface-viz) as an example use-case to motivate our approach.
Our use-case is an API around a database containing owners and their pets.
We include five endpoints families:
1. [**\<get-owners\>**](#5.get-owners): retrieves a list of URIs representing all registered owners
2. [**\<get-owner\>**](#6.get-owner): fetches an individual owner along with their associated pets
3. [**\<post-owner\>**](#1.post-owner): registers a new owner in the system
4. [**\<patch-owner\>**](#2.patch-owner): updates an existing owner
5. [**\<change-owner\>**](#3.change-owner): transfers a pet from one owner to another.
Important to note is that our system _explicitly_ models the `<database>` information resource, meaning other systems can now reference the resource 
'_all known owners and their pets registered in service X_', and deduce what endpoints manipulate it.

This paper presents a vision for a future in which interfaces formally describe their underlying resources and how to manipulate them,
creating rich, composable, and formal interface semantics.
Our goal is to stimulate discussion on how such descriptions can support autonomous operation,
improve agent reliability, and pave the way for more interoperable and adaptive knowledge infrastructures.
While the proposed direction remains conceptual,
we offer initial ideas and mappings that illustrate how this approach could be realized in practice.

In the [next section](#related-work) we review related work, discussing various existing ways to describe data interfaces.
In [](#vision) we detail our vision, and we conclude our paper in [](#conclusion).
[](#annex) contains the complete description of our example in [](#interface-viz).
