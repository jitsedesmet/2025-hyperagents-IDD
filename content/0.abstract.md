<!-- Context: Why the need is so pressing or important -->
Autonomous data management over data systems like Decentralized data ecosystems is increasingly central to agentic systems,
yet data interfaces lack the formal semantics needed for autonomous agents to act reliably.
<!-- Need: Why something needed to be done at all -->
To enable machine reasoning in these environments,
we must bridge the semantic gap between read and write operations across heterogeneous, asymmetric interfaces.
<!-- Task: What was undertaken to address the need -->
This paper proposes a formal approach to describing data interfaces using algebraic flows over state and event spaces.
<!-- Object: What the present document does or covers -->
We introduce Interface Data Description (IDD), which models the semantic behavior of read and write endpoints as composable transformations.
<!-- Findings: What the work done yielded or revealed -->
Our approach reveals that existing interface logic can be reframed algebraically without requiring significantly more effort from developers.
<!-- Conclusion: What the findings mean for the audience -->
This enables agents to reason about data provenance, interface consequences, and permissible modifications in a principled way.
<!-- Perspectives: What the future holds, beyond this work -->
Looking ahead, IDD opens avenues for policy-aware semantics,
privacy-preserving interface disclosure, and standardization through community-driven efforts.
