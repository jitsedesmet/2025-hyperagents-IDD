<!-- Context: Why the need is so pressing or important -->
In the age of agentic systems, correct autonomous data management is increasingly critical.
<!-- Need: Why something needed to be done at all -->
Agents need to discover what resources exist and how to interact with them,
but existing interface description frameworks that could provide such support
either leave too much open to interpretation or fail to model underlying resources, which are not directly exposed.
<!-- Task: What was undertaken to address the need -->
To address this gap, we propose a declarative description that describes underlying resources and their transformations by modeling interfaces as algebraic flows that declaratively define how underlying resources are exposed, derived, and manipulated. 
<!-- Object: What the present document does or covers -->
We detail our vision by walking through an example use case that showcases the various problems agents have when
interacting with data interfaces and incrementally present our solution of modeling how data flows within the system.
<!-- Findings: What the work done yielded or revealed -->
Our approach shows that interface developers can express their systems using familiar query languages,
while enabling autonomous agents to reason about the consequences of actions and determine required operations to manipulate resources safely and predictably. 
<!-- Conclusion: What the findings mean for the audience -->
This makes deterministic interactions with complex, asymmetric information interfaces possible.
<!-- Perspectives: What the future holds, beyond this work -->
Looking ahead, we aim to formalize this approach into a theoretically sound framework with a proof-of-concept implementation.
Additionally, we identify promising avenues for integrating policy-aware semantics and privacy-preserving interface disclosure.
