<!-- Context: Why the need is so pressing or important -->
Autonomous data management over data systems like <span class="comment" data-author="RT">Do you mean "in" instead of "like"?</span> Decentralized data ecosystems is increasingly central to agentic systems,
yet data interfaces lack the formal semantics needed for autonomous agents to act reliably.
<!-- Need: Why something needed to be done at all -->
To enable machine reasoning in these environments,
we must bridge the semantic gap between read and write operations across heterogeneous, asymmetric interfaces <span class="comment" data-author="RT">Do you **only** focus on asymmetric interfaces? Or do you mean **potentially** asymmetric interfaces?</span>.
<!-- Task: What was undertaken to address the need -->
This article proposes a formal approach to describing data interfaces using algebraic flows over state and event spaces.
<!-- Object: What the present document does or covers -->
We introduce the Interface Data Description (IDD), which <span class="comment" data-author="RT">...is a framework that...</span> models the semantic behavior of read and write endpoints <span class="comment" data-author="RT">interfaces instead of endpoints? To stick to consistent terminology.</span> as composable transformations.
<!-- Findings: What the work done yielded or revealed -->
Our approach reveals that existing interface logic can be reframed algebraically without requiring significantly more effort from developers <span class="comment" data-author="RT">Which developers are this exactly? Client-side? Server-side? API? ... Also, I'm a bit sceptical that it doesn't require significant effort :-)</span>.
<!-- Conclusion: What the findings mean for the audience -->
This enables agents to reason about data provenance, interface consequences, and permissible modifications in a principled way.
<!-- Perspectives: What the future holds, beyond this work -->
<span class="comment" data-author="RT">The examples you list below are a bit fuzzy, could you make them more concrete?</span>
<span class="comment" data-author="RT">Also, (some of) these examples should probably come earlier in the abstract (in the context part).</span>
Looking ahead, IDD opens avenues for policy-aware semantics,
privacy-preserving interface disclosure, and standardization through community-driven efforts<span class="comment" data-author="RT">Not sure what to imagine with this first one.</span>.
