<!-- Context: Why the need is so pressing or important -->
<span class="comment" data-author="RV">Just a reminder that we don't have to solve all problems in a large space. We can be zoomed in from the start (maybe on intermediate resources, see later) and stay at that level. Now, we start from the Big Space Of Agents and the Big Space Of Data Management, which is probably not a necessity and works against us in being specific.</span>
In the age of agentic systems, autonomous data management is increasingly critical.
<span class="comment" data-author="RV">I'm not sure I see the connection, nor that I agree. How does the criticality of data management stem from agentic systems? And what is <q>autonomous</q> in this specific context? Let's try going significantly more specific; better to contribute something concrete to a smaller space, than something vague to a bigger one.</span>
<!-- Need: Why something needed to be done at all -->
Agents need to discover what resources exist and how to interact with them,
but existing interface description frameworks that could provide such support
either leave too much open to interpretation or fail to model intermediate resources that are not exposed directly.
<span class="comment" data-author="RV">What are intermediate resources though? If they are so crucial (as the task seems to imply), we might narrow down the context and need to just those intermediate resources, and describe them there.</span>
<!-- Task: What was undertaken to address the need -->
To address this gap, we propose a declarative interface description that describes intermediate resources and their transformations by modeling interfaces as algebraic flows that declaratively define how intermediate resources are exposed, derived, and manipulated. 
<!-- Object: What the present document does or covers -->
We distinguish between persistent resources, and ephemeral resources,
and describe how to interrelate these through algebraic descriptions and how to expose the described resources.
<!-- Findings: What the work done yielded or revealed -->
Our approach shows that interface developers can express their systems using familiar query languages, while enabling autonomous agents to reason about the consequences of actions and determine required operations to manipulate resources safely and predictably. 
<!-- Conclusion: What the findings mean for the audience -->
This makes deterministic interaction with complex, asymmetric information interfaces possible.
<!-- Perspectives: What the future holds, beyond this work -->
Looking ahead, we aim to formalize this approach into a theoretically sound framework with a proof-of-concept implementation. Additionally, we identify promising avenues for integrating policy-aware semantics and privacy-preserving interface disclosure.
