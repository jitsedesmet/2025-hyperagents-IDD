<span class="comment" data-author="RV">There's a lot of new information in almost every single sentence. It feels like we're packing too much in here. What's our (single) need/goal? And, possibly, boundary conditions to achieving it (like developer support)? It reads disconnected at the moment, where every sentence seems to introduce a new idea, while it is unclear how it connects to previous sentences or ideas.</span>


<!-- Context: Why the need is so pressing or important -->
Autonomous data management over data systems like decentralized data ecosystems is increasingly central to agentic systems,
<span class="comment" data-author="RV">It's very hard to parse this first part of the sentence; I don't know what we're trying to say</span>
yet data interfaces lack the formal semantics needed for autonomous agents to act reliably.
<span class="comment" data-author="RV">So if this is the problem, I'd be more specific in introducing this. There's a lot to unpack. We claim there's a reliability problem: what does that mean (exactly what is unreliable?), and do we have some (light) substantiation/illustration? Then, secondly and separately, we claim the cause of this reliability problem is the lack of semantics. Or, alternatively, we claim that the reliability problem can be fixed by semantics (which is not the same thing).</span>
<span class="comment" data-author="RV">At this point, we shouldn't assume that readers have the same understanding of <q>data interfaces</q> that we have. We're thinking about HTTP APIs, right? They might be thinking about the Model Context Protocol or other things.</span>
<!-- Need: Why something needed to be done at all -->
To enable machine reasoning in these environments,
<span class="comment" data-author="RV">And why do we want to do that? Because we had established previously that the problem as lack of formal semantics; now the need/problem seems to be machine reasoning. That doesn't directly follow from the previous.</span>
we must bridge the semantic gap between read and write operations across heterogeneous, asymmetric interfaces.
<span class="comment" data-author="RV">And that does not follow directly either. I personally understand where you are going with this sentence here, but I have a lot of context that readers do not have. The heterogeneous and asymmetric aspects are new here.</span>
<!-- Task: What was undertaken to address the need -->
<ins class="comment" data-author="RV">To (fix/improve/change this situation)â€¦,</ins>
We developed a formal approach to describing data interfaces using algebraic flows over state and event spaces.
<!-- Object: What the present document does or covers -->
In this article, we introduce Interface Data Description (IDD), which models the semantic behavior of read and write endpoints as composable transformations.
<span class="comment" data-author="RV">There's a lot of new information in every sentence. Composability and transformations come out of the blue.</span>
<!-- Findings: What the work done yielded or revealed -->
Our approach reveals that existing interface logic can be reframed algebraically without requiring significantly more effort from developers.
<span class="comment" data-author="RV">Yes, but, do we achieve our goal / address the need stated above? The developer effort is also a new theme here.</span>
<!-- Conclusion: What the findings mean for the audience -->
This enables agents to reason about data provenance, interface consequences, and permissible modifications in a principled way.
<span class="comment" data-author="RV">Is this new, or is this how we achieve the goal / need?</span>
<!-- Perspectives: What the future holds, beyond this work -->
Looking ahead, IDD opens avenues for policy-aware semantics,
privacy-preserving interface disclosure, and standardization through community-driven efforts.
