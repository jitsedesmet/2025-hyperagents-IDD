<!-- Context: Why the need is so pressing or important -->
In the age of agentic systems, autonomous data management - agents autonomously managing data that was unknown at an agentâ€™s design time - <span class="comment" data-author="RT">I'd remove this part, as it makes the sentence less fluent to read</span> is increasingly critical.
<!-- Need: Why something needed to be done at all -->
While many interface description frameworks have been proposed to help agents discover what resources exist and how to interact with them,
<span class="comment" data-author="RT">You start with the cause of the problem here (declarativity), and then mention the actual problem (leaving much open to interpretation). I'd flip them.</span>
they all lack a declarative way to describe underlying resources and their transformations.
As a result, existing descriptions either leave too much open to interpretation or fail to model intermediate resources that are not exposed directly.
<!-- Task: What was undertaken to address the need -->
To address this gap, we propose modeling interfaces as algebraic flows that declaratively define how underlying resources are exposed, derived, and manipulated. 
<!-- Object: What the present document does or covers -->
We distinguish between stateful resources, which store durable data, and bus resources <span class="comment" data-author="RT">"bus resources" sound a bit weird. Maybe we can name them stateless resources? This contrasts nicely with stateful resources.</span>, which model ephemeral event-driven data,
and describe how to interrelate these through algebraic descriptions and how to expose the described resources.
<!-- Findings: What the work done yielded or revealed -->
Our approach shows that interface developers can express their systems using familiar query languages, while enabling autonomous agents to reason about the consequences of actions and determine required operations to manipulate resources safely and predictably. 
<!-- Conclusion: What the findings mean for the audience -->
This makes deterministic interaction with complex, asymmetric information interfaces possible.
<!-- Perspectives: What the future holds, beyond this work -->
Looking ahead, we aim to formalize this approach into a theoretically sound framework with a proof-of-concept implementation. Additionally, we identify promising avenues for integrating policy-aware semantics and privacy-preserving interface disclosure.
